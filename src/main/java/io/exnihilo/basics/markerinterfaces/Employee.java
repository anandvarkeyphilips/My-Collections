/**
 * (1) a marker interface must be empty, and (2) implementing it is meant to imply some special treatment of the implementing class.
 * Incorrect: JVM or the compiler would treat the objects of that class differently:
 * Correct: it is the code of Java class library that treats these objects as cloneable, serializable, etc.
 * It has nothing to do with the compiler or the JVM.
 * <pre>
 * else if (obj instanceof Serializable) {
 *     writeOrdinaryObject(obj, desc, unshared);
 * } else {
 *     if (extendedDebugInfo) {
 *         throw new NotSerializableException();
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * instead of instanceOf operator why can't it be writeObject(Serializable) so that there is compile-time type checking.
 * This lets you avoid polluting your code with the name of the marker interface when a "plain Object" is needed.
 * For example, if you make a class that needs to be serializable, and has object members,
 * you would be forced to either do casting or make your objects Serializable at compile time.
 * This is inconvenient, because the interface is devoid of any functionality.
 *
 * @see Employee
 * If annotations had been in the language from the start,
 * it is doubtful that Serializable would have been an interface, it probably would have been an annotation.
