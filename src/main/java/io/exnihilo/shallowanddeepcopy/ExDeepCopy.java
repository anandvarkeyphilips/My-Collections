/**
 * Whenever we use default implementation of clone method we get shallow copy of object means it creates new instance
 * and copies all the field of object to that new instance and returns it as object type, we need to explicitly cast
 * it back to our original object. This is shallow copy of the object.
 * clone() method of the object class support shallow copy of the object.
 * <p>
 * If the object contains primitive as well as nonprimitive or reference type variable in shallow copy, cloned object
 * cloned object also refers to the same object to which the original object refers as only the object references gets
 * copied and not the referred objects themselves. Thatâ€™s why the name shallow copy or shallow cloning in Java.
 * If only primitive type fields or Immutable objects are there then there is no difference between shallow and deep copy in Java.
